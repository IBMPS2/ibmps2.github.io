                    <h2>Security considerations</h2>
                </div>
                <p>It is incredibly vital that security of data and the website as a whole is taken into consideration. Chollerton Tea Rooms only requests basic information such as email, mobile numbers etc however this alone opens a huge opportunity for exploiters. Due to this, information saved on this website must be secure at all times in order to prevent such abuse occurring from opportunists looking to maliciously use the data that is stored on this website. </p>
                <p>Due to the simplistic nature of how Chollerton Tea Rooms is currently operating, further security measures will need to be implemented. An example of this would be SSL. SSL (short for Secure Sockets Layer) would allow the website to create an encrypted connection between the web servers and the users browsers by requiring an SSL certificate, making the data sent from the browsers to the server encrypted and private. If any user data belonging or is involved with Chollerton Tea room users is compromised, it is the legal responsibility of those responsible for the website to report the breach to such individuals within 72 hours in accordance of ICO regulations. Failure to do this will be in breach of the ICO with consequences unless a valid reason is produced for said delay.</p>
