			<h2>Promoting African Lives stories by bridging the gap between digital and physical space through QR-coded monuments in the North-East of England - 24/03/2022 </h2>
			<p>The African lives in the North- East of England (ALinNE) project requires a technological solution to invoke social change in the form of highlighting the presence and success of people of African descent in the Northeast. We ideate and design prototypes of a QR-code based technology for aiding this social change expedition via several human centred design techniques. We review existing literature to extract justifications and limitations, create personas and storyboards to understand our stakeholders, and develop paper and digital prototypes. We consider the possibilities and boundaries associated with QR-code technology and culminate in a solution derived from iterative developments addressing issues throughout the process. We discuss our findings conclude how our designed technology appropriately addresses the required social change challenge and how it can be improved in future developments.  </p>
			<h2>A review of Machine Learning Models Applied to Detecting Brain Tumours with Magnetic Resonance Images - 09/05/2022</h2>
			<p>According to Cancer Research UK (2019) after a detection of a Malignant brain tumour, 40% will survive for 1 year or more with more than 10% surviving for 5 years or more. With high mortality rate, detecting such tumours at the earliest possible time can increase the impact of surgery and treatment (CRTN, 2021). The use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging images has been shown to be the most detailed and present the most consistent images, especially when applied to the brain (Abd-Ellah et al., 2019). With the early success of applying CNN for image classification tasks with ImageNet (Krizhevsky, 2012), other applications using similar machine learning technology for real-world problems were actively developed. Different machine learning models have been applied to determine whether magnetic resonance images of brain scans are normal, benign or malignant, as seen in (Sasikala and Kumaravel, 2008). Applying machine learning has been shown to speed up the diagnosis process, reduce manual workforce required and even achieve sub-human performance in some cases (Mohsen et al., 2018). This paper will go into detail regarding how Machine Learning using the most effective and competent methodologies that have been discussed, can be applied to increase the speed and accuracy of detecting and diagnosing a brain tumour.   </p>

            <h2>Discussing the claimed decline of Object-Oriented Systems - 20/12/2021</h2> <!-- Location -->
            <p>This research identifies the increasing need for programming methodologies which are capable of simplistic and independent queries. This demand has been created from the developments of technology and the increase in big data demands, in which OOP does not suffice due to a lack of ability to create independent functions. A fall in the use of OOP is also seen with the switch from Monolithic systems to Micro Services, and the switch from Rich Domain models to Anaemic Domain models. Despite this, the advantages of OOP over other programming methodologies are still present today, and with the ability to implement multiple programming methodologies into one program, it is likely that OOP will become irrelevant in the industry.</p> <!--Postcode -->

			<h2>Ettercap, ARP spoofing and countermeasures - 04/11/2020</h2>
			<p>This report discusses the mechanisms within the 
TCP/IP protocol Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and the 
security concerns that are involved due to the lack of any 
verification within ARP cache. The use of the network tool 
Ettercap and how it provides easy access to the capability of 
performing ARP poisoning and subsequently Man in the Middle 
attack on a Local Area Network (LAN) through the use of a 
demonstration using honeypot devices in order to simulate a LAN 
between a web word-press website and a client machine and using 
Ettercap to intercept packets sent to and from the client machine. 
The countermeasures which have been provided over the years to 
mitigate the security concerns within ARP and how effective they 
are such as S-ARP and built in port security on switches and their 
own security issues are also discussed.</p>
			<h2>Cyber security risks within a small business - 04/11/2020</h2>
			<p> This report discusses the further cyber security 
threats and issues in which the company m57.biz should be aware 
of and the means in which they can mitigate and prevent such 
issues in the future in order to make m57.biz as secure as possible 
when it comes to cyber security.</p>
