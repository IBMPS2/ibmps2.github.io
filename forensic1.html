			<h2>Investigating how business policy and I.T. infrastructure affect the way forensic practitioners are able to gather evidence - 12/05/2021</h2>
			<p>This project had the aim of creating a list of recommendations to business’s based on forensic practitioner’s perceived issues in business policy and I.T. infrastructure as well as the mitigations to those issues.This is achieved through interviewing two forensic practitioners.Despite the two forensic practitioners working from different areas (Newcastle and AbuDhabi), there was little difference in the answers they provided.Both forensic practitioners explained that the main issues in business policy and I.T. infrastructure were poorly managed network log retention policies, poorly configured audit policies ona network, wrongly configured user access policies, and poorly designed domain encryption standards.Both forensic practitioners believed that businesses would not be willing to implement changes unless they were made fully aware of the potential risks ofnot changing their policies and configurations.</p>
			<p>From the results taken from the interviews with forensic practitioners, these results were used to create three scenarios within a virtual test environment. The virtual test environment consisted of a domainincluding a domain server VM running Windows Server 2012 R2, and two VMs running Windows 10 x64.The two VMs running Windows 10 were domain users, VM1 and VM2. VM1 being assigned to the developer’sdomain group, and VM2 being assigned to the marketing domain group.</p>
			<p>The issues and mitigations were implemented into the test environment, with all three suggested mitigations mostly resolving the issues present in the corresponding issue in business policy and I.T. infrastructure.</p>
			<p>The final recommendation for businesses is to properly configure the network log retention policy to fit in linewith what network traffic they expect to receive, what storage they can allocate, and what is their average incident response time.It is also recommended to setup an audit policy based on domain users and to not use the default configuration which only covers the local machine, this audit policy should cover all actions of domain users within the file system.The audit policy should also include a system restore point so the audited logs can be used to identify a file that has been deleted, which can thensubsequently be restored.Encryptions should also be handled server side through the domain server providing a certificate to encrypt a file to a domain user, as opposed to the default configuration which has the local machine handle itsown encryption, resulting in the potential for the encryption key to be lost if a user leaves the domain.A backup of the encryption keys/certificates should also be kept on a remote network drive ifthe original encryption keys/certificates becomeinaccessible.</p>

            <h2>Windows Phone - WPI as an alternative extraction method - 02/05/2021</h2> <!--Postcode -->
            <p>This report discusses Cellebrite UFED and Windows Phone Internals which can be used for forensic analysis of devices running Windows phone OS and compares them using a Nokia Lumia 930 and 630. It discusses the lack of support from a forensic perspective for all Windows phone OS’s and the security features and OS architecture which make it difficult for software to acquire data off a device without using JTAG methods. While Windows Phone Internals was very hardware dependant on its success rate in placing a device into mass storage mode and requiring a lot of preparation of the file permissions, Cellebrite UFED was unable to access any data outside of the public directory and thus was only able to extract user media files. The recommendation for forensic analysis of devices running Windows phone OS is to extract using JTAG, due to the unreliability of Windows Phone Internals caused by hardware compatibility issues, and Cellebrite’s very small list of supported devices with Physical extraction.</p> <!-- Telephone -->

			<h2>Critical analysis and evaluation of the capture, analysis, and forensic value of physical memory - 30/04/2021</h2>
			<p>This report discusses the acquisition and examination of physical memory on a Windows 10 based machine (ThinkPad X61s), which has had actions performed on it to simulate data that may be present on a device used in a bank robbery, to identify the forensic value of RAM memory dumps. The tools FTK Imager and Magnet RAM Capture are used to create a RAM memory dump on the device, both before and after restart to utilise “fast startup” built in which loads hiberfile.ini into RAM on reboot. The forensic value of the data identified is significant with Magnet Axiom Process (utilising Volatility) and Examine identifying multiple artifacts with forensic value within the uploaded memory dumps including browser history, file data (including a previously deleted file), Google map searches, event viewer logs, User accounts, locally connected devices, and entered excel passwords. Information regarding command line arguments, emails, browser searches in incognito mode and social media URLs were identified on memory dumps before shutdown. The identified artifacts and the potentially significant forensic value of that data displays the significant importance of memory dump analysis when it comes to a forensic investigation. This is especially true for data which would otherwise not be recoverable such as some private browsing data and entered username and password credentials.</P>

			<h2> Critical analysis and review of the methods and approach used by investigation CRN/123456 (Northumbria University) - 06/01/2021</h2>
			<p>This report identifies and discusses the investigation CRN/123456 and the methods and approach used in conducting the investigation. It identifies the clear correlation between CRN/123456 and the ACPO guidelines [1] as well as the Criminal procedures and Investigations Act 1996 [2]. While key info could be established in the examination, including a link between Sarah Roberts device and the messages received by Jackie Butterfield, issues are identified in the method and approach. This is due to the removal of SIM cards from mobile devices (potentially resulting in the destruction or change in data), the lack of a module card used to create a forensic copy of the SIM card, lack of information regarding how the SIM card was removed, lack of data recovered from 3rd party apps, and issues within the audit trail regarding the lack of disclosure of issues in mobile forensics such as volatile memory and the potential for 3rd party software to alter data. The recommended solutions for this is the inclusion of physical extraction to include 3rd party app data, the details of the SIM card and call log data being taken from the provider itself when possible, and the improvement of the audit trail, including the potential issues caused by 3rd party forensic software in mobile forensic analysis and the issues caused by volatile memory when it comes to data integrity.</p>
			<h2>M57.BIZ Forensic report (Northumbria Uni)- 04/11/2020</h2>
			<p>Evidential findings corresponding to be involved in the leak of personal details of company 
employees at m57.biz including the leak of names, employee status and social security number.
</p>
			<p>With the following emails examined and investigated, it is the belief that the sensitive data of 
employees at m57.biz including their names, position at the company and their social security 
number were leaked by the Chief Financial Officer Jean Jones on 20/07/2008 01:28:00 through 
means of an email to tuckgorge@gmail.com which appears as alison@m57.biz in the senders 
name in order to spoof the email (impersonate Alison Smith, CEO of m57.biz). The file which Jean 
Jones sent to tuckgorge@gmail.com was m57biz.xls, this is an excel document containing the 
personal details of those working at the company, including full name, position at the company, 
salary and social security number. This also includes the annual salary at the company, benefits 
and monthly burn.</p>
			<p>It is believed that Jean Jones passing this sensitive data to tuckgorge@gmail.com whom was 
impersonating Alison Smith was due to Alison Smith requesting such data on 19/07/2008 23:39:57 
UTC where she requests a spreadsheet including the details found in m57biz.xls for means of 
showing them to potential investors in order to run background checks. Alison Smith also states at 
the ending of his email “Please do not mention this to anybody.”
</p>
			<p>Jean Jones confirms the details within m57.biz through confirming her Social Security Number and 
Salary through an email sent by Bob Blackman (Programmer for apps 1). Jean Jones sent this 
email to Bob Blackman on 21/07/2008 00:46:00 UTC. This is after originally denying any 
knowledge of Social Security numbers being leaked (This could be down to a lack of knowledge of 
the email she sent containing m57biz.xls was being sent to a spoofed email address or due to 
Alison Smith and Tomgorge@gmail.com requesting that emails involving m57biz.xls are not 
mentioned to anyone else). Bob Blackman states that he found this information through “someone 
just sent me email saying that my name and SNN had been posted. I dont really know what this is 
about.”
